# slack-chatDelete-bot

A script for GAS with linking Google spread sheet access, a Container Bound Script.

This bot can automatically toggle to delete oldest post with a set of schedules.

# Notice

It does not affect to #general channel and any DM.

The token keys are not displayed in here because of the sensitive information to put in a public.

Trigger settings are applied in a GAS, not in a source code.

This is a Container Bound Script, which means the Google spread sheet is linked directly with this script file, not a separated spread sheet which anyone can edit spread sheet.

This project uses SlackApp library with version 22.
You must choose version 22 in order to prevent failure to enable the library.
